<h1><font color="blue">Movement Control Order Phase 1</font></h1>

		<font size="4">Since the beginning of MCO, i'm always eating,sleeping, playing games and watch news about Covid19. For this phase i'm more dedicated to rest myself and getting more closer to my family.

	<p> 
		YouTube also one of the platform that keep entertain me during this MCO. I'm always listening to music and follow up my favourite artist. They are Stray Kids!!! So during this MCO, I'm listening to their latest song : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkxWIAe3NDU">Mixtape.</a>

<h1><font color="blue">Movement Control Order Phase 2</font></h1>

		<font size="4">At this phase, i'm fully charged (means not getting tired due to oversleeping) and i'm decided to workout a little bit to ensure my health at a good status by doing some exercise at home such as Yoga.

	<p>
		<br>Another than that, I also do a lot of works at home such as:-</br>
		<br>1. Dish wash</br>
		<br>2. Home facial treatment</br>
		<br>3. Cooking</br>
		<br>4. Self hair treatment</br>
		<br>5. Just anything as long as it work!</br>
